  Cell-to-cell gene expression variability is an inherent feature of complex 
  biological systems, such as immunity and development. Single-cell RNA 
  sequencing is a powerful tool to quantify this heterogeneity, but it is prone 
  to strong technical noise. In this article, we describe a step-by-step 
  computational workflow which uses the BASiCS Bioconductor package to robustly 
  quantify expression variability within and between known groups of cells (such 
  as experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS uses an integrated framework 
  for data normalisation, technical noise quantification and downstream 
  analyses, whilst propagating statistical uncertainty across these steps. 
  Within a single seemingly homogeneous cell population, BASiCS can identify 
  highly variable genes that exhibit strong heterogeneity as well as lowly 
  variable genes with stable expression. BASiCS also uses a probabilistic 
  decision rule to identify changes in expression variability between cell 
  populations, whilst avoiding confounding effects related to differences in 
  technical noise or in overall abundance. Using two publicly available 
  datasets, we guide users through a complete pipeline which includes 
  preliminary steps for quality control as well as data exploration 
  using the scater and scran Bioconductor packages. Data for the first case 
  study was generated using the Fluidigm\@ C1 system, in which extrinsic 
  spike-in RNA molecules were added as a control. The second dataset was 
  generated using a droplet-based system, for which spike-in RNA is not 
  available. This analysis provides an example, in which differential 
  variability testing reveals insights regarding a possible early cell fate 
  commitment process. The workflow is accompanied by a Docker image that 
  ensures the reproducibility of our results.

## Quantifying cell-to-cell transcriptional variability - `BASiCS`

The `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` Bioconductor package contains an assembly of 
functions to estimate and analyse gene- and cell-specific model parameters 
[@Vallejos2015BASiCS; @Vallejos2016; @Eling2018].
`BASiCS` is build upon a hierarchical Baysian framework and as such samples 
posterior distribution for each model parameter.
In mathematical terms, the gene expression count $X_{ij}$ for gene $i$ in cell 
$j$ is modelled as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_{ij}|\mu_i,\nu_j&\sim{}\text{Poisson}(\nu_j\mu_i)\\
\nu_j|s_j,\theta&\sim{}\text{Gamma}(1/\theta,1/(s_j\theta))\\
\rho_{ij}|\delta_i&\sim{}\text{Gamma}(1/\delta_i,1/\delta_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mu_i$ explains the gene's mean expression, $\nu_j$ the technical effect 
characterised by the mRNA capture efficiency $s_j$ and the unexplained technical
noise parameter $\theta$. 
<!-- Here, $\phi_j$ is the cell-specifc size factor and  -->
Here, $\rho_{ij}$ the biological 
random effect fluctuating around the gene-specific over-dispersion 
hyper-parameter $\delta_i$.
It is important to note that, in further analyses, $\mu_i$ represents the
mean expression and $\delta_i$ the biological over-dispersion of each gene.

Due to a strong association between mean expression and biological 
over-dispersion, the model has been extended to correct for such confounding 
effect. To this end, the prior distribution for the over-dispersion parameters 
has been changed to:

$$
\delta_i | \mu_i \sim \text{log-t}_{\eta}\left( \text{f}(\mu_i), \sigma^2 \right).
$$

where $\text{f}(\mu_i)$ describes a smooth regression trend between the 
over-dispersion and the mean expression parameters.
This extension introduced the residual over-dispersion parameters 
$\epsilon_i=\delta_i-\text{f}(\mu_i)$ that do not scale with mean expression
[@Eling2018].

From a data analysis perspective, the `BASiCS_MCMC` function is the heart of 
the `BASiCS` package, and can be run in four different settings (see Table 1). 

: Four settings that can be used to run the `BASiCS_MCMC` function.

                        No regression         Regression           
----------------------- --------------------  -------------------
Using spike-in reads    `WithSpikes = TRUE`   `WithSpikes = TRUE`  
                        `Regression = FALSE`  `Regression = TRUE` 
No spike-ins available  `WithSpikes = FALSE`  `WithSpikes = FALSE` 
                        `Regression = FALSE`  `Regression = TRUE`
----------------------- --------------------  -------------------

If spike-in counts are availabe and should be used to estimate technical noise,
the parameter `WithSpikes` is set to `TRUE` (default).
If the regression between over-dispersion and mean expression should be 
performed, the `Regression` parameters is set to `TRUE` (default).
If the user decides to set `Regression = FALSE`, `BASiCS` will not estimate 
the regression trend, and will not supply the residual over-dispersion 
parameters $\epsilon_i$.

The `BASiCS_MCMC` function returns a `BASiCS_Chain` object, which can be used 
for further downstream analyses, many of which are detailed in this workflow.
These objects contain draws from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers,
which are used to infer the posterior distribution over the model parameters
[@Smith1993].
Briefly, the posterior distribution quantifies how probable different parameter 
values are given the observed data. However, before assessing the posterior
distribution, we must first ensure that the MCMC sampler has converged to
its stationary distribution, and has sampled efficiently from this distribution
[@Cowles1996]. If these conditions are not met, then the estimated parameters
may be inaccurate. The `r CRANpkg("coda")` CRAN package contains a variety of 
functions to assess the convergence of a sampled MCMC chain. 
To use `coda` functions, the individual chains returned by `BASiCS` need to be 
transformed into a MCMC object that `coda` recognises using the `coda::mcmc` 
function. `BASiCS` also offers a number of functions to visualise and assess the 
convergence of MCMC chains. In particular, we will use 
`BASiCS_EffectiveSize` and `BASiCS_DiagPlot` to calculate and visualise the
effective sample size generated by the MCMC samplers.

## Other steps [title tbc]

The `r Biocpkg("goseq")` Bioconductor package offers functions to detect the 
enrichment of gene ontologies (GOs) among user-specified gene sets [@Young2010].
Furthermore, `goseq` corrects for gene length biases, which is useful for full 
length scRNA-seq data as highlighted in the first section. 
In this workflow, we will use `goseq` to detect GO enrichment among 
differentially expressed sets of genes.

For downstream analysis, such as GO enrichment analysis or the biological 
interpretation of individual genes, we need to (i) link each gene's ID to its 
symbol and (ii) calculate each gene's length.
For the first task, the `r Biocpkg("biomaRt")` Bioconductor package annotates a 
wide range of gene and gene product identifiers [@Durinck2005] by accessing the 
BioMart software suite ([http://www.biomart.org](http://www.biomart.org)).
We can use `biomaRt` to link the **Mus musculus** gene IDs and to their gene 
symbols (also referred to as 'gene name'):
