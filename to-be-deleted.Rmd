abstract: |
  Cell-to-cell gene expression variability is an inherent feature of complex 
  biological systems, such as immunity and development. Single-cell RNA 
  sequencing is a powerful tool to quantify this heterogeneity, but it is prone 
  to strong technical noise. In this article, we describe a step-by-step 
  computational workflow which uses the BASiCS Bioconductor package to robustly 
  quantify expression variability within and between known groups of cells (such 
  as experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS uses an integrated framework 
  for data normalisation, technical noise quantification and downstream 
  analyses, whilst propagating statistical uncertainty across these steps. 
  Within a single seemingly homogeneous cell population, BASiCS can identify 
  highly variable genes that exhibit strong heterogeneity as well as lowly 
  variable genes with stable expression. BASiCS also uses a probabilistic 
  decision rule to identify changes in expression variability between cell 
  populations, whilst avoiding confounding effects related to differences in 
  technical noise or in overall abundance. Using two publicly available 
  datasets, we guide users through a complete pipeline which includes 
  preliminary steps for quality control as well as data exploration 
  using the scater and scran Bioconductor packages. Data for the first case 
  study was generated using the Fluidigm\@ C1 system, in which extrinsic 
  spike-in RNA molecules were added as a control. The second dataset was 
  generated using a droplet-based system, for which spike-in RNA is not 
  available. This analysis provides an example, in which differential 
  variability testing reveals insights regarding a possible early cell fate 
  commitment process. The workflow is accompanied by a Docker image that 
  ensures the reproducibility of our results.
