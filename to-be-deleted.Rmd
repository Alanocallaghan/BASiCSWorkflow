abstract: |
  Cell-to-cell gene expression variability is an inherent feature of complex 
  biological systems, such as immunity and development. Single-cell RNA 
  sequencing is a powerful tool to quantify this heterogeneity, but it is prone 
  to strong technical noise. In this article, we describe a step-by-step 
  computational workflow that uses the BASiCS Bioconductor package to robustly 
  quantify expression variability within and between known groups of cells (such 
  as experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS uses an integrated framework 
  for data normalisation, technical noise quantification and downstream 
  analyses, whilst propagating statistical uncertainty across these steps. 
  Within a single seemingly homogeneous cell population, BASiCS can identify 
  highly variable genes that exhibit strong heterogeneity as well as lowly 
  variable genes with stable expression. BASiCS also uses a probabilistic 
  decision rule to identify changes in expression variability between cell 
  populations, whilst avoiding confounding effects related to differences in 
  technical noise or in overall abundance. Using a publicly available 
  dataset, we guide users through a complete pipeline that includes 
  preliminary steps for quality control, as well as data exploration 
  using the scater and scran Bioconductor packages. Data for the case 
  study was generated using the Fluidigm\@ C1 system, in which extrinsic 
  spike-in RNA molecules were added as a control. The workflow is accompanied 
  by a Docker image that ensures the reproducibility of our results.

# Introduction

<!--- scRNA-seq and the different types of heterogeneity ---> 
<!--- Nils to revisit and add additional references if required --->
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of genome-wide 
transcriptional heterogeneity in cell populations that is not 
captured by bulk experiments [@Stegle2015; @Prakadan2017; @Patange2018]. 
On the broadest level, this heterogeneity can reflect the presence of distinct 
cell subtypes or states. 
Alternatively, it can be due to gradual changes along biological processes, 
such as development and differentiation. 
Several clustering and pseudotime inference methods have been developed to
characterise these types of heterogeneity [@Kiselev2019; @Saelens2019].
However, there is a limited availability of computational tools tailored 
to study more subtle variability within seemingly homogeneous cell populations. 
This variability can reflect deterministic or stochastic events that regulate
gene expression and, among others, has been reported to increase prior to cell
fate decisions [@Mojtahedi2016] as well as during ageing [@Martinez-jimenez2017]. 


Stochastic variability within a seemingly homogeneous cell population --- often 
referred to as transcriptional *noise* --- can arise from intrinsic and 
extrinsic sources [@Elowitz2002; @Eling2019]. 
Extrinsic noise refers to stochastic fluctuations induced by 
different dynamic cellular states (e.g. cell cycle, metabolism, 
intra/inter-cellular signalling) [@Zopf2013; @Iwamoto2016; @Kiviet2014]. 
In contrast, intrinsic noise arises from stochastic effects on biochemical 
processes such as transcription and translation [@Elowitz2002].
Intrinsic noise can be modulated by genetic and epigenetic modifications (such 
as mutations, histone modifications, CpG island length and nucleosome 
positioning) [@Eberwine2015; @Faure2017; @Morgan2018] and usually occurs 
at the gene level [@Elowitz2002]. 
Cell-to-cell gene expression variability estimates derived from scRNA-seq data 
capture a combination of these effects, as well as deterministic regulatory 
mechanisms [@Eling2019]. 
Moreover, these variability estimates can also be inflated by the technical 
noise that is typically observed in scRNA-seq data [@Brennecke2013].

<!--- Experimental strategies to tackle technical noise --->
Different strategies have been incorporated into scRNA-seq protocols to control 
or attenuate technical noise. 
For example, external RNA spike-in molecules (such as the set introduced by the 
External RNA Controls Consortium, ERCC [@Rna2005]) can be added to each cellâ€™s 
lysate in a (theoretically) known fixed quantity.
Spike-ins can assist quality control steps [@McCarthy2017], data normalisation
[@Vallejos2017] and can be used to infer technical noise [@Brennecke2013].
Another strategy is to tag individual cDNA molecules using unique molecular 
identifiers (UMIs) before PCR amplification [@Islam2014]. 
Reads that contain the same UMI can be collapsed into a single molecule count,
attenuating technical variability associated to cell-to-cell differences
in amplification and sequencing depth (these technical biases are not fully 
removed unless sequencing to saturation [@Vallejos2017]). 
However, despite the benefits associated to the use of spike-ins and UMIs, 
these are not available for all scRNA-seq protocols [@Haque2017].

The Bioconductor package `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` aims to account for these
sources of noise, both technical and biological. In particular, we
encourage the use of UMIs when performing a scRNAseq study.
It is well-established that scRNAseq data is distributed
according to a negative binomial distribution when UMIs are used in the 
sequencing protocol [@Svensson2020;@Townes2020;@Townes2019]. Thus, the
distributional assumptions of `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` are more likely to be valid
for datasets wherein UMIs have been used. Furthermore, 
`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` leverages spike-in molecules to aid in normalisation when
available, though a recent extension of the model allows the application of
the model in the absence of spike-in molecules [@Eling2018]. Moreover,
`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` enables the quantification of variability within a 
population, while accounting for the overall mean-variance relationship in
an scRNAseq dataset [@Eling2018].


<!--- Describes aims for the workflow and introduces BASiCS ---> 
This article complements existing scRNA-seq workflows based on the Bioconductor 
ecosystem (e.g. [@Lun2016; @Kim2019]), providing a detailed framework for 
transcriptional variability analyses. 
Firstly, we describe a step-by-step workflow that uses
`r Biocpkg("scater")` [@McCarthy2017] and `r Biocpkg("scran")` [@Lun2016] 
to perform quality control (QC) as well as initial exploratory analyses. 
To robustly quantify transcriptional variability we use `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` 
[@Vallejos2015; @Vallejos2016; @Eling2017] --- a Bayesian hierarchical framework 
that jointly performs data normalisation, technical noise quantification and 
downstream analyses, whilst propagating statistical uncertainty across these 
steps. 
Our analysis pipeline includes practical guidance to assess the convergence of 
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that is used to infer model 
parameters as well as recommendations to interpret and post-process the model 
outputs. 
Finally, through a case study in the context of immune cells, we illustrate
how `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` can be used to identify highly and lowly variable
genes within a cell population, as well as to compare expression profiles
between experimental conditions or cell types. 

All source code used to generate the results presented in this article is 
available [on Github](https://github.com/VallejosGroup/BASiCSWorkflow).
To ensure the 
reproducibility of this workflow, the analysis environment and all software 
dependencies are provided as a Docker image [@Boettiger2015]. The image 
can be obtained from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/alanocallaghan/bocker).


# Methods {#methods}

This step-by-step scRNA-seq workflow is primarily based on the Bioconductor 
package ecosystem [@Amezquita2019]. 
A graphical overview is provided in Figure \@ref(fig:overview) 
and its main components are described below. 

```{r overview, out.width=out_width, out.height=out_height, fig.cap = 'Graphical overview for the scRNA-seq analysis workflow described in this manuscript. Starting from a matrix of expression counts, we use the scater and scran Bioconductor packages to perform QC and initial exploratory analyses. To robustly quantify transcriptional heterogeneity within seemingly homogeneous cell populations, we apply the BASiCS Bioconductor package and  illustrate how BASiCS can be used to analyse a single or multiple pre-specified groups of cells.', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/Overview.png")
```


### Input data

```{r}
library("SingleCellExperiment")
```

We use `r Biocpkg("SingleCellExperiment")` to convert an input
matrix of raw read-counts (molecule counts for UMI-based protocols) into a 
`SingleCellExperiment` object that can also store its associated 
metadata, such as gene- and cell-specific information. 
Moreover, when available, the same object can also store read-counts for 
spike-in molecules (see `?altExp`).
A major advantage of using a `SingleCellExperiment` object as the input for 
scRNA-seq analyses is the interoperability across a large number of 
Bioconductor packages [@Amezquita2019]. 

## QC and exploratory data analysis

```{r}
library("scater")
library("scran")
```

An critical step in scRNA-seq analyses is QC, removing low quality samples that 
may distort downstream analyses. 
In this step, we use QC diagnostics to identify and remove samples that 
correspond to broken cells, that are empty, or that contain multiple cells 
[@Ilicic2016]. We  also typically remove lowly expressed genes that represent 
less reliable information. 
The [*OSCA*](https://osca.bioconductor.org/) online book provides an extensive
overview on important aspects of how to perform QC of scRNA-seq data, including
exploratory analyses [@Amezquita2019].

Here, we use the `r Biocpkg("scater")` package [@McCarthy2017] to calculate 
QC metrics for each cell (e.g. total read-count) and gene (e.g. percentage of 
zeroes across all cells), respectively. 
Moreover, we use the visualisation tools implemented in `r Biocpkg("scater")` to 
explore the input dataset and its associated QC diagnostic metrics. 
For further exploratory data analysis we use the `r Biocpkg("scran")` package 
[@Lun2016].
The latter can perform *global scaling* normalisation, calculating 
cell-specific scaling factors that capture global differences in read-counts 
across cells (e.g. due to sequencing depth and PCR amplification) 
[@Lun2016pooling]. 
To quantify transcriptional variability, `r Biocpkg("scran")` can be used to 
infer an overall trend between mean expression and the squared coefficent of 
variation (CV^2^) for each gene. 
To derive variability estimates that are not confounded by this overall trend, 
`r Biocpkg("scran")` also defines gene-specific DM (distance to the mean) 
estimates as the distance between CV$^2$ and a rolling median along the range 
of mean expression values [@Kolodziejczyk2015cell].
DM estimates enable exploratory analyses of cell-to-cell gene expression 
variability, but a measure of statistical uncertainty is not readily available 
for these estimates. 
As such, gene-specific downstream inference (such as differential variability 
testing) is precluded.


## BASiCS - Bayesian Analysis of Single Cell Sequencing data

```{r}
library("BASiCS")
```

The `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` package uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework 
that borrows information across all genes and cells to robustly quantify 
transcriptional variability [@Vallejos2015BASiCS].
Similar to the approach adopted in `r Biocpkg("scran")`, `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` 
infers cell-specific global scaling normalisation parameters. 
However, instead of inferring these as a pre-processing step, 
`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` uses an integrated approach wherein data normalisation 
and downstream analyses are performed simultaneously, thereby propagating
statistical uncertainty. 
To quantify technical noise, the original implementation of 
`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` uses information from extrinsic spike-in molecules as 
control features, but the model has been extended to address situations wherein
spike-ins are not available [@Eling2018].

`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` summarises the expression pattern for each gene through 
gene-specific *mean* and *over-dispersion* parameters. 
Mean parameters $\mu_i$ quantify the overall expression for each gene $i$
across the cell population under study.
In contrast, $\delta_i$ captures the excess of variability that is observed with 
respect to what would be expected in a homogeneous cell population, beyond 
technical noise. 
`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` uses $\delta_i$ as a proxy to quantify transcriptional 
variability.
To account for the strong relationship that is typically observed 
between gene-specific mean expression and over-dispersion estimates, 
Eling *et al.*  [@Eling2018] introduced a joint prior specification for 
these parameters. 
This joint prior formulation has been observed to improve posterior inference
when the data is less informative (e.g. small sample size, lowly expressed 
genes), borroring information across all genes to infer an overall trend that
captures the relationship between mean and over-dispersion.
The trend is then used to derive gene-specific *residual over-dispersion* 
parameters $\epsilon_i$ that are not confounded by mean expression. 
Similar to DM values implemented in `r Biocpkg("scran")`, these are defined as 
deviations with respect to the overall trend.

Within a population of cells, `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` decomposes the total 
observed variability in expression measurements into technical and biological 
components [@Vallejos2015]. 
This enables the identification of *highly variable genes* (HVGs) that capture
the major sources of heterogeneity within the analysed cells [@Brennecke2013]. 
HVG detection is often used as feature selection, to identify the input 
set of genes for subsequent analyses. 
`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` can also highlight *lowly variable genes* (LVGs) that 
exhibit stable expression across the population of cells.
These may relate to essential cellular functions and can assist the development
of new data normalisation or integration strategies [@Lin2019].

`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` also provides a probabilistic decision rule to 
perform differential expression analyses between two (or more) pre-specified 
groups of cells [@Vallejos2016; @Eling2018].
While several differential expression tools have been proposed for scRNA-seq 
data (e.g. [@Kharchenko2014; @Finak2015]), some evidence suggests that 
these do not generally outperform popular bulk RNA-seq tools [@Soneson2018]. 
Moreover, most of these methods are only designed to uncover changes in overall
expression, ignoring the more complex patterns that can arise at the single cell 
level [@Lahnemann2020]. 
Instead, `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` embraces the high granularity of scRNA-seq data,
uncovering changes in cell-to-cell expression variability that are not 
confounded by differences in technical noise or in overall expression.

# Case study: analysis of naive CD4^+^ T cells {#Tcells}

As a case study, we use scRNA-seq data generated for CD4^+^ T cells
using the C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm^Â®^). 
Martinez-Jimenez _et al._ profiled naive (hereafter also referred to as 
unstimulated) and activated (3 hours using _in vitro_ antibody stimulation) 
CD4^+^ T cells from young and old animals across two mouse strains to study 
changes in expression variability during ageing and upon immune activation 
[@Martinez-jimenez2017].
They extracted naive or effector memory CD4^+^ T cells from spleens of young or 
old animals, obtaining purified populations using either magnetic-activated cell 
sorting (MACS) or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
External ERCC spike-in RNA [@Rna2005] was added to aid the quantification of 
technical variability across all cells and all experiments were performed in 
replicates (hereafter also referred to as batches).

## Downloading the data

The matrix with raw read counts can be obtained from ArrayExpress under the 
accession number 
[E-MTAB-4888](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-4888/).
In the matrix, column names contain library identifiers and row names
display gene Ensembl identifiers. 

```{r naive-data}
if (!file.exists("downloads/raw_data.txt")) {
  website <- "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-MTAB-4888/"
  file <- "E-MTAB-4888.processed.1.zip"
  download.file(
    paste0(website, file),
    destfile = "downloads/raw_data.txt.zip"
  )
  unzip("downloads/raw_data.txt.zip", exdir = "downloads")
  file.remove("downloads/raw_data.txt.zip")
}

CD4_raw <- read.table("downloads/raw_data.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
CD4_raw <- as.matrix(CD4_raw)
```

The input matrix contains data for `r format(ncol(CD4_raw), big.mark=",")`
cells and `r format(nrow(CD4_raw), big.mark=",")`
genes (including `r sum(grepl("ERCC", rownames(CD4_raw)))` ERCC spike-ins). 
Information about experimental conditions and other metadata is available 
under the same accession number. 

```{r selecting-serum-cells}
if (!file.exists("downloads/metadata_file.txt")) {
  website <- "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-MTAB-4888"
  file <- "E-MTAB-4888.additional.1.zip"
  download.file(
    paste0(website, file),
    destfile = "downloads/metadata.txt.zip"
  )
  unzip("downloads/metadata.txt.zip", exdir = "downloads")
  file.remove("downloads/metadata.txt.zip")
}

CD4_metadata <- read.table(
  "downloads/metadata_file.txt",
  header = TRUE,
  sep = "\t"
)

# Save sample identifiers as rownames
rownames(CD4_metadata) <- CD4_metadata$X
```

The columns in the metadata file contain library identifiers (`X`), strain 
information (`Strain`; *Mus musculus castaneus* or *Mus musculus domesticus*), 
the age of the animals (`Age`; young or old), stimulation state of the cells 
(`Stimulus`; naive or activated), batch information (`Individuals`; associated 
to different mice), and cell type information (`Celltype`; via FACS or MACS 
purification). 

Here, we convert the data and metadata described above into a 
`SingleCellExperiment` object. 
For this purpose, we first separate the input matrix of expression counts into
two matrices associated to intrinsic genes and external spike-ins, respectively. 
Within the `SingleCellExperiment` object, the latter is stored separately
as an *alternative experiment* (see `?altExp`).

```{r CD4-SCE-object}
# Separate intrinsic from ERCC counts
bio_counts <- CD4_raw[!grepl("ERCC", rownames(CD4_raw)), ]
spike_counts <- CD4_raw[grepl("ERCC", rownames(CD4_raw)), ]
# Generate the SingleCellExperiment object
sce_CD4_all <- SingleCellExperiment(
  assays = list(counts = as.matrix(bio_counts)),
  colData = CD4_metadata[colnames(CD4_raw), ]
)
# Add read-counts for spike-ins as an alternative experiment
altExp(sce_CD4_all, "spike-ins") <- SummarizedExperiment(
  assays = list(counts = spike_counts)
)
```

Hereafter, our analysis focuses on naive and activated CD4^+^ T cells obtained 
from young *Mus musculus domesticus* animals, purified using MACS-based cell sorting. 
Here, we extract these 
`r sum(sce_CD4_all$Strain == "Mus musculus domesticus" & sce_CD4_all$Age == "Young" & sce_CD4_all$Celltype == "MACS-purified Naive")` samples.

```{r naive-activated-CD4-SCE-object}
ind_select <- sce_CD4_all$Strain == "Mus musculus domesticus" &
  sce_CD4_all$Age == "Young" &
  sce_CD4_all$Celltype == "MACS-purified Naive"
sce_naive_active <- sce_CD4_all[, ind_select]
sce_naive_active
```

## QC and exploratory data analysis

The data available at 
[E-MTAB-4888](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-4888/) have
been already filtered to remove poor quality samples.
The QC applied in [@Martinez-jimenez2017] removed cells with: (i) fewer 
than 1,000,000 total reads, (ii) less than 20% of reads mapped to 
endogenous genes, (iii) less than 1,250 or more than 3,000 detected genes and 
(iv) more than 10% or fewer than 0.5% of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes.
As an illustration, we visualise some of these metrics. 
We also include another widely used QC diagnostic plot that compares the total 
number (or fraction) of spike-in counts versus the total number (or fraction) of 
endogeneous counts.
In such a plot, low quality samples are characterised by a high fraction of 
spike-in counts and a low fraction of endogeneous counts 
(see Figure \@ref(fig:PerCellQC)).

```{r PerCellQC, fig.cap="Cell-level QC metrics. The total number of endogenous read-counts (excludes non-mapped and intronic reads) is plotted against the total number of detected genes (left) and the total number of spike-in read-counts (right)."}
# Calculate and plot per cell QC metrics
sce_naive_active <- addPerCellQC(sce_naive_active, use_altexps = TRUE)
p_cellQC1 <- plotColData(
  sce_naive_active, 
  x = "sum", 
  y = "detected") +
  xlab("Total engogenous reads per cell") +
  ylab("Number of detected genes per cell") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, angle = 45))
p_cellQC2 <- plotColData(
  sce_naive_active, 
  x = "sum", 
  y = "altexps_spike-ins_sum") +
  xlab("Total engogenous reads per cell") +
  ylab("Total spike-in reads per cell") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, angle = 45))

library(cowplot)
plot_grid(p_cellQC1, p_cellQC2, ncol = 2)
```

We can also visualise these metrics with respect to cell-level metadata, such
as the experimental conditions (active vs unstimulated) and the different mice 
that cells were collected from 
(see Figure \@ref(fig:experimental-condition-batch)). 

```{r experimental-condition-batch, fig.cap="Cell-level QC metrics according to cell-level metadata. The total number of endogenous reads (excludes non-mapped and intronic reads) is plotted against the total number of detected genes. Colour indicates the experimental condition (left) and animal of origin (right) for each cell."}
p_stimulus <- plotColData(
    sce_naive_active,
    x = "sum",
    y = "detected", 
    colour_by = "Stimulus"
  ) +
  xlab("Total engogenous reads per cell") +
  ylab("Number of detected genes per cell") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
p_batch <- plotColData(
    sce_naive_active,
    x = "sum",
    y = "detected", 
    colour_by = "Individuals"
  ) +
  xlab("Total engogenous reads per cell") +
  ylab("Number of detected genes per cell") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
plot_grid(p_stimulus, p_batch, ncol = 2)
```

To further explore the underlying structure of the data, we compute global
scaling normalisation factors using `r Biocpkg("scran")` and perform a 
principal component analysis (PCA) of log-transformed normalised expression 
counts using `r Biocpkg("scater")`.
As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:pca-visualisation-stimulus-batch), this analysis 
suggests the absence of strong batch effects.
It should be noted that `r Biocpkg("scran")` normalisation
is not strictly necessary in the `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` workflow and we only
use it here as part of the exploratory data analysis.
Moreover, count-based models for dimensionality reduction (e.g. [@Townes2019;@Lopez2018]) could be used as an alternative to PCA, 
removing the need for log normalisation .

```{r pca-visualisation-stimulus-batch, fig.cap="First two principal components of log-transformed expression counts after scran normalisation. Colour indicates the experimental condition (left) and animal of origin (right) for each cell."}
# Global scaling normalisation + log tranformation + PCA
sce_naive_active <- computeSumFactors(sce_naive_active)
sce_naive_active <- logNormCounts(sce_naive_active)
sce_naive_active <- runPCA(sce_naive_active)
p_stimulus <- plotPCA(sce_naive_active, colour_by = "Stimulus") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
p_batch <- plotPCA(sce_naive_active, colour_by = "Individuals") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
plot_grid(p_stimulus, p_batch, ncol = 2)
```

In addition to cell-specific QC, we also recommend the use of a gene filtering 
step prior to the use of `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")`. 
The purpose of this filter is to remove lowly expressed genes that were largely
undetected through sequencing, making reliable variability estimates difficult
to obtain.
Here, we remove all genes that are not detected in at least 5 cells across both 
experimental conditions or that have an average read count below 1. 
These thresholds can vary across datasets and should be informed by 
gene-specific QC metrics such as those shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:gene-selection).

```{r gene-selection, fig.cap="Average read-count for each gene is plotted against the number of cells in which that gene was detected. Dashed grey lines are shown at the thresholds below which genes are removed."}
# Calculate per gene QC metrics
sce_naive_active <- addPerFeatureQC(sce_naive_active, exprs_values = "counts")
# Remove genes with zero total counts across all cells
sce_naive_active <- sce_naive_active[rowData(sce_naive_active)$detected != 0, ]
# Transform 'detected' metadata into number of cells 
rowData(sce_naive_active)$detected_cells <- 
  rowData(sce_naive_active)$detected * ncol(sce_naive_active) / 100
# Define inclusion criteria for genes
rowData(sce_naive_active)$include_gene <- rowData(sce_naive_active)$mean >= 1 &
  rowData(sce_naive_active)$detected_cells >= 5
plotRowData(
    sce_naive_active,
    x = "detected_cells",

    colour_by = "include_gene") +

geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", col = "grey60")
# Apply gene filter
sce_naive_active <- sce_naive_active[rowData(sce_naive_active)$include_gene, ]
```

Subsequently, we also require users to remove spike-in molecules that were not 
captured through sequencing. We will do this separately for naive and active
cells separately.

```{r spike-ins-present}
ind_active <- sce_naive_active$Stimulus == "Active"
ind_naive <- sce_naive_active$Stimulus == "Unstimulated"
spikes <- assay(altExp(sce_naive_active))
detected_spikes_active <- rowSums(spikes[, ind_active] > 0) > 0
detected_spikes_naive <- rowSums(spikes[, ind_naive] > 0) > 0
detected_spikes <- detected_spikes_naive & detected_spikes_active
altExp(sce_naive_active) <- altExp(sce_naive_active)[detected_spikes, ]
```

The final dataset used in subsequent analyses contains 
`r ncol(sce_naive_active)` cells, `r nrow(sce_naive_active)` genes and 
`r nrow(altExp(sce_naive_active))` spike-ins.

## Input data for BASiCS

Here, we apply the `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` model separately to cells from each
experimental condition (`r sum(sce_naive_active$Stimulus == "Unstimulated")` 
naive and `r sum(sce_naive_active$Stimulus == "Active")` activated cells). 
We create separate `SingleCellExperiment` objects for each group of cells. 

```{r SCE-separation}
sce_naive <- sce_naive_active[, ind_naive]
sce_active <- sce_naive_active[, ind_active]
```

`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` requires the user to update these objects with additional
information, using a specific format.
Firstly, if multiple batches of sequenced cells are available (e.g. multiple 
donors that cells were extracted from, or multiple sequencing batches from the 
same experimental condition), this information must be included under the 
`BatchInfo` label as part of the cell-level metadata.

```{r BatchInfo}
colData(sce_naive)$BatchInfo <- colData(sce_naive)$Individuals
colData(sce_active)$BatchInfo <- colData(sce_active)$Individuals
```

If spike-ins will be used to aid data normalisation and technical noise 
quantification, `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` also requires the number of spike-in 
molecules that were added to each well. 
For each spike-in gene $i$, this corresponds to:

$$ \mu_{i} = C_i \times 10^{-18} \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}) 
\times V \times D \hspace{0.5cm} \mbox{where,} $$

- $C_i$ is the concentration for the spike-in $i$ (measured in $aM\mu{}l^{-1}$),
- $V$ is the volume added into each well (measure in $nl$) and
- $D$ is a dilution factor. 

The remaining factors in the equation above are unit conversion constants
(e.g. from moles to molecules). 
For the CD4^+^ T cell data, the authors added a 1:50,000 dilution of the ERCC 
spike-in mix 1 and a volume of $9nl$ was added into each well (see [https://www.fluidigm.com/faq/ifc-9](https://www.fluidigm.com/faq/ifc-9)).
Finally, input concentrations $C_i$ can be downloaded from 
[https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/cms_095046.txt).

```{r spike-in_download}
if (!file.exists("downloads/spike_info.txt")) {
  website <- "https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals"
  file <- "cms_095046.txt"
  download.file(
    paste0(website, file),
    destfile = "downloads/spike_info.txt"
  )  
}

ERCC_conc <- read.table("downloads/spike_info.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
```

Based on this information, the calculation above proceeds as follows

```{r, ercc-mul}
# Moles per micro litre
ERCC_mmul <- ERCC_conc$concentration.in.Mix.1..attomoles.ul. * (10^(-18))
# Molecule count per micro litre (1 mole comprises 6.02214076 x 10^{23} molecules)
ERCC_countmul <- ERCC_mmul * (6.02214076 * (10^23))
# Application of the dilution factor (1:50,000)
ERCC_count <- ERCC_countmul / 50000
# Multiplying by the volume added into each well
ERCC_count_final <- ERCC_count * 0.009
```

To update the `sce_naive` and `sce_active` objects, the user must create a 
`data.frame` whose first column contains the labels associated to 
the spike-in molecule (e.g. ERCC-00130) and whose second column contains the 
input number of molecules calculated above.
We add this information as metadata for `altExp(sce_naive)` and 
`altExp(sce_active)`, respectively. 

```{r spike-info}
SpikeInput <- data.frame(
  Names = ERCC_conc$ERCC.ID,
  count = ERCC_count_final
)
# Exclude spike-ins not included in the input SingleCellExperiment objects
# and ensure the order of the rows is identical
SpikeInput <- SpikeInput[match(rownames(altExp(sce_naive)), SpikeInput$Names), ]

metadata(sce_naive)$SpikeInput <- SpikeInput
metadata(sce_active)$SpikeInput <- SpikeInput
```

## Parameter estimation using BASiCS

Parameter estimation is implemented in the `BASiCS_MCMC` function using an 
adaptive Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm [@Roberts2009].
The primary inputs for `BASiCS_MCMC` correspond to:

- `Data`: a `SingleCellExperiment` object created as described in the 
  previous sections. 
- `N`: the total number of MCMC iterations.
- `Thin`: thining period for output storage
  (only the `Thin`-th MCMC draw is stored).
- `Burn`: the initial number of MCMC iterations to be discarded.
- `Regression`: if `TRUE` a join prior is assigned to $\mu_i$ and $\delta_i$ 
  [@Eling2018], and residual over-dispersion values $\epsilon_i$ are inferred. 
  Alternatively, independent log-normal priors are assigned to $\mu_i$ and 
  $\delta_i$ [@Vallejos2016]. 
- `WithSpikes`: if `TRUE` information from spike-in molecules is used to aid
  data normalisation and to quantify technical noise. 
  
<!--- CV: It may be worth to introduce the EB related parameter here too ---> 

As a default, we recommend to use `Regression = TRUE` as we have observed that
the joint prior introduced by Eling *et al.* leads to more stable, particularly 
for small sample sizes and lowly expressed genes. 
Moreover, the joint prior formulation enables users to obtain a measure of
transcriptional variability that is not confounded by mean expression. 
Additional optional parameters can be used to store the generated output 
(`StoreChains`, `StoreDir`, `RunName`) and to monitor the progress of the 
algorithm (`PrintProgress`). 

Here, we run the MCMC sampler separately for naive and activated cells.
We use 40,000 iterations, discarding the initial 20,000 iterations.
We recommend this setting as a default choice, as we have observed it to 
ensure good convergence for the algorithm across multiple datasets.
However, for large datasets and less sparse datasets, a lower number of 
iterations may be sufficient. 
Practical guidance about the diagnostics criteria required to assess the 
performance of the MCMC algorithn is provided in the next section.

```{r MCMC-run, eval = FALSE}
chain_naive <- BASiCS_MCMC(
  Data = sce_naive,
  N = 40000,
  Thin = 20,
  Burn = 20000,
  Regression = TRUE,
  WithSpikes = TRUE,
  StoreChains = TRUE,
  StoreDir = "rds/",
  RunName = "naive"
)

chain_active <- BASiCS_MCMC(
  Data = sce_active,
  N = 40000,
  Thin = 20,
  Burn = 20000,
  Regression = TRUE,
  WithSpikes = TRUE,
  StoreChains = TRUE,
  StoreDir = "rds/",
  RunName = "active"
)
```

This first of these samplers takes 127 minutes to complete on a 3.4 GHz Intel 
Core i7 4770k procesor with 16GB RAM, while the second takes 75 minutes.
For convenience, these can be obtained online at 
[https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/vallejosgroup/basicsworkflow2020](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/vallejosgroup/basicsworkflow2020).

```{r download-chain-naive}
if (!file.exists("rds/chain_naive.Rds")) {
  website <- "https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/vallejosgroup/basicsworkflow2020/raw/master/"
  file <- "chain_naive.Rds"
  download.file(
    paste0(website, file),
    destfile = "rds/chain_naive.Rds"
  )  
}
if (!file.exists("rds/chain_active.Rds")) {
  website <- "https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/vallejosgroup/basicsworkflow2020/raw/master/"
  file <- "chain_active.Rds"
  download.file(
    paste0(website, file),
    destfile = "rds/chain_active.Rds"
  )  
}
chain_naive <- readRDS("rds/chain_naive.Rds")
chain_active <- readRDS("rds/chain_active.Rds")
```

The output from `BASiCS_MCMC` is a `BASiCS_Chain` object that contains the 
draws associated to all model parameters (as `N` = 40,000, `Thin` = 20 and
`Burn` = 20,000, the object contains 1,000 draws for each parameter).
These can be accessed using the `displayChainBASiCS` function.
For example, the following code displays the first 2 draws for mean
expression parameters $\mu_i$ associated to the first 3 genes.

```{r displayChainBASiCS}
displayChainBASiCS(chain_naive, Param = "mu")[1:2, 1:3]
```

## MCMC diagnostics

Before interpreting the parameter estimates obtained by `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")`, 
it is critical to assess the convergence of the MCMC algorithm, i.e. whether
the MCMC reached its stationary distribution.
If convergence has been achieved, each parameter should not (on average) evolve
significantly across iterations, and MCMC draws are expected to be stochastic 
fluctuations around a horizontal trend.
Generally, it is not possible to prove convergence but multiple graphical and
quantitative convergence diagnostics have been proposed to assess the lack
of convergence (e.g. [@CowlesCarlin1996; @BrooksGelman1998]). 
Some advocate the use of multiple MCMC chains using different starting values in
order to ensure that the algorithm consistently converges to the same 
distribution.
For `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")`, we have observed that using informed starting values 
(e.g. based on `r Biocpkg("scran")` normalisation) and a sufficiently large 
value for `N` and `Burn` generally leads to consistent across multiple MCMC runs.
Hence, the focus of this section is to evaluate quantitative measures of 
convergence (e.g. [@Geweke1995]) based on a single MCMC chain.

Traceplots can be used to visually assess the history of MCMC iterations 
for a specific parameter (e.g. Figure \@ref(fig:convergence-naive)). 
As mentioned above, significan departures from a horizontal trend suggest a
lack of convergence.
As illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:convergence-naive), histograms can also be 
used to display the marginal distribution for each parameter. 
Users should expect these to follow a unimodal distribution. 
Failure to satisfy these graphical diagnostics suggest that `N` and `Burn` must 
be increased. 
Alternatively, more stringent quality control could be applied to the input 
data, as genes with very low counts often suffer from slow convergence and poor sampling efficiency.

```{r convergence-naive, fig.cap="Trace plot, marginal histogram, and autocorrelation function for a gene in naive cells following MCMC sampling. Trace plots should explore the posterior well, without getting stuck in one location or drifting over time towards a region of higher density. High autocorrelation indicates that the number of effective independent samples is low. It is good practice to perform these visualisation for many different parameters; here we only show one."}
plot(chain_naive, Param = "mu", Gene = 1)
```

As `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` infers thousands of parameters, it is 
impractical to assess these diagnostics for each parameter. 
Thus, it is helpful to use numerical diagnostics, applied to multiple
parameters simultaneously.
Here, we focus on the diagnostic criterion proposed by Geweke [@Geweke1995]
which compares the average draws obtained during the initial (10\% after burn 
in, by default) and the final part of the chain (50\% by default).
Large absolute $Z$-scores suggest that the algorithm has not converged. 
For the naive and activatived CD4^+^ T datasets most Z-scores associated to mean
expression parameters $\mu_i$ were small in aboslute value (see 
Figure \@ref(fig:geweke-diag)).

<!--- CAV: I removed the next sentence, trend is not that clear
after applying the additional gene filter. 

Further, as seen in Figures \@ref(fig:geweke-diag-mean) and
\@ref(fig:geweke-diag-detected), genes with large absolute values for this 
criterion are often those genes that have a low average expression level, or 
that are expressed only in a small proportion of cells.
---> 

```{r geweke-diag, fig.cap="Geweke Z-score for mean expression parameters is plotted against mean expression estimates for naive (left) and activated (right) cells.", eval = FALSE}
library("coda")
library("ggplot2")
library("viridis")

# Calculate and plot Geweke Z scores 
gew_mu_naive <- geweke.diag(mcmc(displayChainBASiCS(chain_naive, Param = "mu")))$z
gew_mu_active <- geweke.diag(mcmc(displayChainBASiCS(chain_active, Param = "mu")))$z

myplot_params <- list(
  geom_hex(),
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(-3, 3), col = "firebrick", linetype = "dashed"),
  scale_fill_viridis(),
  labs(x = "log(mu)", y = "Geweke Z-score"))

p_geweke_naive <- ggplot() +
  aes(
    log10(colMedians(displayChainBASiCS(chain_naive, Param = "mu"))),
    gew_mu_naive
  ) +
  myplot_params +
  ggtitle("Naive cells")
p_geweke_active <- ggplot() +
  aes(
    log10(colMedians(displayChainBASiCS(chain_active, Param = "mu"))),
    gew_mu_active
  ) +
  myplot_params+
  ggtitle("Activated cells")

plot_grid(p_geweke_naive, p_geweke_active, ncol = 2)
```

As well as assessing MCMC convergence, it is important to ensure that the MCMC 
algorithm has efficiently explored the parameter space. 
For example, the autocorrelation function (e.g. Figure 
\@ref(fig:convergence-naive), right panel) can be used to quantify the 
correlation between the chain and its lagged versions. 
Strong autocorrelation indicates that neighbouring MCMC samples are highly 
dependent and suggest poor sampling efficiency. 
The latter may indicate that the MCMC draws do not contain 
sufficient information to produce accurate posterior estimates.
In other words, highly correlated MCMC samplers require more samples to produce
the same level of Monte Carlo error for an estimate 
(defined as the variance of a Monte Carlo estimate across repetitions [@Koehler2009]). 

The effective sample size (ESS) is a related measure which represents a proxy 
for the number of independent draws generated by the MCMC sampler [@Gelman2014].
The latter is defined as:
$$
  \mbox{ESS} = \frac{N_{tot}}{1 + 2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \rho(k)},
$$
where $N_{tot}$ represents the total number of MCMC draws (after burn-in and
thining) and $\rho(k)$ $\rho(k)$ is the autocorrelation at lag $k$.
ESS estimates associated to mean expression parameters for the naive and 
activated CD4^+^ T cells are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:ess-diag).
Whilst ESS is around 1,000 ($N_{tot}$ in this case) for most genes, we observe 
low ESS values for a small proportion of genes (primarily lowly expressed genes 
whose expression was only captured in a small number of cells).
As described later in this manuscript, `BASiCS_TestDE` automatically excludes 
genes with low ESS when performing differential expression testing.

```{r ess-diag, fig.cap="ESS for mean expression parameters is plotted against mean expression estimates for naive (left) and activated (right) cells.", eval = FALSE}
ess_mu_naive <- BASiCS_DiagPlot(chain_naive, Param = "mu") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
ess_mu_active <- BASiCS_DiagPlot(chain_active, Param = "mu") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
plot_grid(ess_mu_naive, ess_mu_active, ncol = 2)
```


## Quantifying transcriptional variability using BASiCS

Studying gene-level transcriptional variability can provide insights about the 
regulation of gene expression, and how it relates to the properties of genomic 
features (e.g. CpG island composition [@Morgan2018]), transcriptional dynamics 
[@Antolovic2017] and aging [@Martinez-jimenez2017], among others. 
The squared coefficient of variation (CV^2^) is widely used as a proxy for 
transcriptional variability. 
For example, here we obtain CV^2^ estimates for each gene using 
`r Biocpkg("scran")` normalised expression counts as input. 
Instead, `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` infers transcriptional variability using 
gene-specific over-dispersion parameters $\delta_i$ (see *Methods*). 
Here, we compare these approaches focusing on naive CD4^+^ T cells (the 
analysis for active cells shows similar results). 
As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:dispersion-vs-mean)A, CV^2^ and posterior estimates 
for $\delta_i$ are highly correlated. 
Moreover, both variability metrics are confounded by differences in mean 
expression, e.g. highly expressed genes tend to exhibit lower variability
(Figures \@ref(fig:dispersion-vs-mean)B-C). 
To remove this confounding, `r Biocpkg("scran")` and `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")`
derive *residual variability* estimates as deviations with respect to an
global mean-variability trend (see *Methods*).
These are derived using the DM apprach [@Kolodziejczyk2015cell] and the
residual over-dispersion parameters $\epsilon_i$ defined by [@Eling2018],
respectively.
For the naive CD4^+^ T data, both approaches led to strongly correlated 
estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:dispersion-vs-mean)D) and, as expected, neither DM 
or posterior estimates for $\epsilon_i$ are seen to be associated with
mean expression (Figure \@ref(fig:dispersion-vs-mean)E-F). 
However, unlike DM, the integrated approach implemented in `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` 
provides a direct measure of statistical uncertainty for these estimates. 
As illustrated in the following sections, this enables gene-specific
downstream inference such as differential variability analyses. 

<!--- CV: Can we make the n_neigh smaller? --->

 <!--- CV: add this when editing caption: Note that the `BASiCS_ShowFit` function can be used to generate panel B, but we generated the plot manually to demonstrate how users can extract this information from a `BASiCS_MCMC` object. For this analysis, we exclude genes that are not expressed in at least 2 cells. These genes have missing (`NA`) values for the residual over-dispersion parameter, $\epsilon$. We use `r CRANpkg("ggpointdensity")` to visualise the local density of genes along the axes of mean and variability. --->

## HVG/LVG detection using BASiCS

`r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` offers the functions `BASiCS_DetectHVG` and 
`BASiCS_DetectLVG` to identify genes with substiantilly large (HVG) or small 
(LVG) transcriptional variability within a population of cells (see *Methods*). 
If the input `BASiCS_Chain` object was generated by `BASiCS_MCMC` with 
`Regression = TRUE` (recommended setting), this analysis is based on the 
posterior distribution inferred for gene-specific residual over-dispersion 
parameters $\epsilon_i$.
Alternatively, the approach introduced by [@Vallejos2015] can be used. 
HVG are marked as those for which $\epsilon_i$ exceeds a user-defined threshold 
with high probability, where the probability cut-off is chosen to match 
a given expected false discovery rate (EFDR; default EFDR = 10\%) [@Newton2004].

<!--- [EXPLAIN BOTH THRESHOLD OPTIONS] [FIRST, FIX BASiCS] --->

these functions take the `BASiCS_Chain` object and a quantile threshold.
Using the residual over-disperison parameters, genes are ranked by their 
variability and the `BASiCS_DetectHVG` function selects (for example) the 
10% most highly variable genes (`PercentileThreshold = 0.9`).
Similarly, when detecting lowly variable genes, the `BASiCS_DetectLVG` selects 
the 10% most lowly variable genes (`PercentileThreshold = 0.1`).

```{r naive-HVG-LVG}
# Highly variable genes
HVG <- BASiCS_DetectVG(chain_naive, Task = "HVG", PercentileThreshold = 0.9)
# Lowly variable genes
LVG <- BASiCS_DetectVG(chain_naive, Task = "LVG", PercentileThreshold = 0.1)
HVG_table <- HVG@Table
LVG_table <- LVG@Table
```

This analysis results in the detection of *`r sum(HVG_table$HVG, na.rm=TRUE)`*
highly variable genes and *`r sum(LVG_table$LVG, na.rm=TRUE)`*
lowly variable genes.

```{r Denoised_naive}
DC_naive <- BASiCS_DenoisedCounts(sce_naive, chain_naive)

# Filter out lowly expressed genes
HVG_table <- HVG_table[HVG_table$Mu > 1,]
LVG_table <- LVG_table[LVG_table$Mu > 1,]

library(reshape2)
topHVG <- log10(t(DC_naive[HVG_table$GeneName[1:3], ]) + 1)
topLVG <- log10(t(DC_naive[LVG_table$GeneName[1:3], ]) + 1)

plot_hvg <- ggplot(melt(topHVG), aes(x = Var2, y = value)) + 
  geom_violin() + coord_flip() + ylim(-0.01,3.2) +
  geom_jitter(position=position_jitter(0.3))
plot_lvg <- ggplot(melt(topLVG), aes(x = Var2, y = value)) + 
  geom_violin() + coord_flip() + ylim(-0.01,3.2) +
  geom_jitter(position=position_jitter(0.3))
plot_grid(plot_hvg, plot_lvg)
```

Here, we define HVGs as those genes with a CV^2^ more than double that
predicted based on mean expression using the fitted trend,
while controlling the FDR to 5%.
As described by `r Biocpkg("SimpleSingleCell")` and by 
[*OSCA*](https://osca.bioconductor.org/), different methods
can be used to identify depending on the intended downstream analysis,
and thresholds should be adjusted based on the characteristics
[@Lun2016;@Amezquita2019]
We can then compare the the overlap of the HVG identified by 
`r Biocpkg("scran")` and by `r Biocpkg("BASiCS")` (shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:scran-HVG)).

```{r scran-HVG, fig.cap="Epsilon (residual over-dispersion) is plotted against log(mu) (log mean expression). Colour indicates the results of scran and BASiCS HVG tests."}
